# Pikelet Documentation

> **Note**:
>
> The documentation is still very much a work in progress, so there is not actually much here yet!

This is where we will document the Pikelet programming language!
We'll aim to provide multiple levels of documentation for different purposes:

- [Guide][guide]: For people new to the language
- [Reference][reference]: For people wanting to learn more about individual language features
- [Contributing][contributing]: For people wanting to contribute to the language
- [Specification][specification]: For Pikelet developers and researchers

[guide]: ./guide
[reference]: ./reference
[contributing]: ./contributing
[specification]: ./specification

More sections might be added later, for example tutorials and cookbooks.
