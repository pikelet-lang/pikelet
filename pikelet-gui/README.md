# pikelet-gui

This is intended to provided the basis for a structured programming environment for Pikelet.
While the hopes behind this are ambitious, we will need to proceed carefully, taking care to avoid getting trapped down rabbit holes.

It should both be natively compiled, be able to be run in a browser, or embedded in other applications, like game engines.
For this, libraries like [Iced](https://github.com/hecrj/iced) could prove useful.
Another possibility could be to embed this within Electron-based IDEs like VS Code.
We might also want to eventually investigate implementing the programming environment using platform-specific GUI toolkits.
