//! The A-normal form language, with types preserved.
//!
//! This language makes an explicit distinction between _computations_ and
//! _values_, and makes the evaluation indifferent to the order in which
//! computations are executed (somewhat like [applicative functors in
//! Haskell][applicative-functors]). It does this through alterations to the
//! syntactic structure of the [core language][crate::lang::core], while
//! avoiding making many significant changes to the type structure which
//! would make type preservation more challenging.
//!
//! The main inspiration for this language is William Bowman's dissertation,
//! [Compiling with Dependent Types][wjb-dissertation].
//!
//! Note: the 'A' in 'A-Normal Form' does not stand for anything, at least
//! [according to one of the original authors, Matthias Felleisen][just-a].
//! I really wish there was a better name for this language.
