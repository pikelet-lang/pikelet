Looking into the future it would also be nice to then move forward towards implementing a native compiler, however. At the moment we are building the language in Rust, but perhaps it would be better to build a verified implementation in Coq/Agda/Lean/Idris/something else. That way we can actually start proving some of the claims we desire to make about our system.
