Looking into the future it would also be nice to then move forward towards implementing a native compiler, however. At the moment we are building the language in Rust, but perhaps it would be better to build a verified implementation in Coq/Agda/Lean/Idris/something else. That way we can actually start proving some of the claims we desire to make about our system. A concern could be that we go too far down the route of implementation and it would be extremely challenging to then form a solid specification for what we are building.

We can improve the performance however by using 'external' iteration - ie. returning a series of chained iterator adaptors, that only perform the allocation on the call to collect . This emulates the 'fusion' that languages like Haskell perform to reduce intermediate allocations.
